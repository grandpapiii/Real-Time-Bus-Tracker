# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
A real time bus tracker that will allow you to view the 12 stops from Boston to MIT and display current bus locations in real time!
Changes that I've made to the codes consist of editing the styling on the buttons, adding the next stop and previous stop buttons instead of having a counter, and adding current bus vehicle locations.

# Road Map to future improvements
Currently, clicking the "show current bus locations" button shows the current real time location of the buses. Clicking the button again will not refresh and clear previous positions of the buses on the map. In the future, I would edit this code so that the user does not have to refresh the page in order to optimize the user interface.

# How to run the code
Clone the files onto your hardware, and open the HTML file onto your browser!
